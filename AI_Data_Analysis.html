									<p><b><font style="color: #F84C1E">Artificial intelligence (AI)</font></b> encompasses a broad field that is primarily interested in training intelligent machines which can help solve problems. From that broad categorization, AI can be broken down into more specific layers: </p>
							<ul>
							  <li><b><font style="color: #F84C1E">Artificial intelligence</font></b> is the broadest category and encompasses all fields involved with creating intelligent machines.</li> 

<li><b><font style="color: #F84C1E">Machine learning</font></b> involves pattern recognition in structured data which is often stored in a tabular format and often employs statistical methods. In fact, linear regression is a supervised machine learning technique.  </li>

<li><b><font style="color: #F84C1E">Deep learning</font></b> is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks, a computational method inspired by the human brain. Because it uses more complex methods, deep learning is better equipped to handle unstructured data types like images, text, or audio. </li>

<li><b><font style="color: #F84C1E">Large language models</font></b> are specifically designed for text. AI chatbots like ChatGPT are based on a LLM which has been trained on a specific set of data. LLMs are also considered generative AI since they are used to produce new content.</li>
</ul>

									<h3 class="major">General Guidelines for AI</h3>
									<img src = "images/chatgpt_flow.png" alt = "" style="float:right;width:25%;height:25%;"/>
									<p>If you’re new to working with AI, there are a few foundational ideas that you should remember. 
			
<ol>
  <li>There always needs to be a “human in the loop” to verify output from AI.</li>
  <li>Generative AI is not a web search. It will generate a new response every time. </li>
  <li>You are <b><font style="color: #F84C1E">conversing</b></font> with AI, not just asking it questions. How you write your prompt matters </li>
  <li>We are all participating in the discovery of AIs. </li>
</ol>
 
It is especially important to remember that LLMs primary goal is to generate human-like text, not true statements because it does not know what the truth is. The following flow chart from a UNESCO report indicates that the first question you should ask when using ChatGPT or a similar AI is “Does it matter if the output is true?”  When using generative AI, you must have the expertise to validate the output and accept responsibility for any decisions or final products.  </p>
